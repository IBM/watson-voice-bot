# Create a web based chatbot with voice input and output

In this code pattern we will create a web based chat bot, but the twist here is that we'll be using voice input and output. For the conversation dialog we'll of course be using Watson Assistant, but we'll also be using Watson Speech To Text to capture the user's voice, and lastly we'll use Watson Text To Speech to playback the chatbots response to the user. The web application itself is built on top of JQuery and Python Flask.

When the reader has completed this code pattern they will understand how to:

* Make a Watson Speech To Text call using a Web Socket Connection
* Make a Watson Text to Speech REST API call
* Send and receive messages to Watson Assistant using REST APIs
* Integrate Watson Speech To Text, Watson Text To Speech and Watson Assistant in a web app

## Flow

1. User selects the microphone option on the browser and speaks.
2. The voice is passed on to Watson Speech To Text using a Web Socket connection.
3. The text from Watson Speech to Text is extracted and sent as input to Watson Assistant.
4. The response from Watson Assistant is passed onto Watson Text to Speech.
5. The audio output is sent to the web application and played back to the user, while the UI also displays the same text.

## Included components

* [Watson Speech-to-Text](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/speech-to-text/): A service that converts human voice into written text.
* [Watson Text-to-Speech](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/text-to-speech/): Converts written text into natural sounding audio in a variety of languages and voices.
* [Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/watson/ai-assistant/): Create a chatbot with a program that conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods.

## Featured technologies

* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/): Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/): It is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.
