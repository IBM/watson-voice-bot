# Watson Voice BOT

In this Code Pattern, we will create a Voice BOT ie. a Web based Chat Bot activated with voice using Watson Speech To Text, Watson Text To Speech, Watson Assistant built on top of JQuery and Python Flask.
In this pattern the chat bot is activated using a voice input and the response is also received as an Audio input. The input and response is also shown on the screen in text format for user verification.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* Make a Watson Speech To Text Call using Web Socket Connection
* Make a Watson Text to Speech REST API call
* Send and receive messages to Watson Assistant using REST APIs
* Integrate Watson Speech To Text, Watson Text To Speech and Watson Assistant into a Voice BOT

## Flow

1. User gives Audio Input through the browser
2. The Audio Input is passed onto Watson Speech To Text using a Web Socket connection
3. The text from Watson Speech to Text is extracted and sent as input to Watson Assistant.
4. The response from Watson Assistant is passed onto Watson Text to Speech and the audio output is given to the user.
5. The UI also displays the text corresponding to the dialog happening in audio format.

## Included components

* [Watson Speech-to-Text](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/speech-to-text.html):  A service that converts human voice into written text.
* [Watson Text-to-Speech](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/text-to-speech/): Converts written text into natural sounding audio in a variety of languages and voices.
* [Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/conversation/): Create a chatbot with a program that conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods.

## Featured technologies

* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/): Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/): It is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.

# Steps

Use the ``Deploy to IBM Cloud`` button **OR** create the services and run locally.

## Deploy to IBM Cloud

[![Deploy to IBM Cloud](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/IBM/watson-voice-bot.git)

1. Press the above ``Deploy to IBM Cloud`` button and then click on ``Deploy``.

2. In Toolchains, click on `Delivery Pipeline` to watch while the app is deployed. Once deployed, the app can be viewed by clicking `View app`.

   ![](doc/source/images/toolchain-pipeline.png)

3. To see the app and services created and configured for this Code Pattern, use the IBM Cloud dashboard. The app is named `CodePattern_VoiceBot-` with a unique suffix. The following services are created and easily identified by the `wvb-` prefix:

   * wvb-speechtotext
   * wvb-texttospeech
   * wvb-assistant

4. Import the Watson Assistant workspace. Follow Step [Import the Conversation workspace](#3-import-the-conversation-workspace) under the Section **Run Locally**

   ![](doc/source/images/application_name.png)

5. Configure Environment Variable. Open the app starting with the name `CodePattern_VoiceBot` from under the [IBM Cloud Dashboard](https://console.bluemix.net/dashboard/apps/) by clicking on the Application name.

  Click on `Runtime` on the left nav.

  Select the `Environment Variables` tab.

  Scroll down and click on `Add`.

  ![](doc/source/images/add_env_variable.png)

  Specify the Enviroment variable name as `WORKSPACEID` and insert the value workspace ID of the Conversation workspace created in Step 4.

  Click `Save` and wait for the application to reload.

## Run locally

> NOTE: These steps are only needed when running locally instead of using the `Deploy to IBM Cloud` button.

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Create Watson services with IBM Cloud](#2-create-watson-services-with-ibm-cloud)
3. [Import the Conversation workspace](#3-import-the-conversation-workspace)
4. [Configure credentials](#4-configure-credentials)
5. [Run the application](#5-run-the-application)

### 1. Clone the repo

Clone the `watson-voice-bot` locally. In a terminal, run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/watson-voice-bot
```

Weâ€™ll be using the file [`data/conversation/assistant/voicebot.json`](data/aassistant/workspaces/voicebot.json) and the folder
[`data/assistant/workspaces/`](data/assistant/workspaces/)

### 2. Create Watson services with IBM Cloud

Create the following services:

* [**Watson Conversation**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/conversation)
* [**Watson Speech To Text**](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/speech-to-text)
* [**Watson Text To Speech**](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/text-to-speech)

### 3. Import the Conversation workspace

Launch the `Watson Assistant` tool. Use the `import` icon button on the right

Find the local version of [`data/assistant/workspaces/voicebot.json`](data/assistant/workspaces/voicebot.json) and select
`Import`. Find the `Workspace ID` by clicking on the context menu of the new
workspace and select `View details`. Save this ID for later.

*Optionally*, to view the conversation dialog select the workspace and choose the
**Dialog** tab, here's a snippet of the dialog:

![](doc/source/images/dialog.png)

If running the application using the toolchain then continue back with Step 5 in the previous section [Configuring Environment variables ](#5-configure-environment-variable)
else move on to Step 4 below.

### 4. Configure credentials

The credentials for IBM Cloud services (Assistant, Speech To Text and Text To Speech), can be found in the ``Services`` menu in IBM Cloud,
by selecting the ``Service Credentials`` option for each service.

The other settings for Conversation was collected during the
earlier setup step (``WORKSPACE_ID``).

Copy the [`env.sample`](env.sample) to `.env`.

```
$ cp env.sample .env (optional)
```

> Note: This is an optional step that you will have to execute in the event where you see that the
credentials are not getting picked up from the Cloud Runtime (`VCAP_SERVICES`) for some reason.
Edit the `.env` file with the necessary settings.

#### `env.sample:`

```
# Replace the credentials here with your own.
# Rename this file to .env before starting the app.

# Watson conversation
CONVERSATION_USER=<add_conversation_username>
CONVERSATION_PASSWORD=<add_conversation_password>
WORKSPACEID=<add_conversation_workspace>

# Watson Speech To Text
SPEECHTOTEXT_USER=<add_stt_username>
SPEECHTOTEXT_PASSWORD=<add stt password>

# Watson Text To SpeechToText
TEXTTOSPEECH_USER=<add tts username>
TEXTTOSPEECH_PASSWORD=<add tts password>
```

### 5. Run the application

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) runtime. Note that you will need version 3.6 or higher.
2. Start the app by running `python welcome.py`
3. Use the chatbot at `localhost:5000`.
4. Click on the mic icon to speak and click again once you are done speaking to record you speech.
> Note: server host can be changed as required in server.js and `PORT` can be set in `.env`.
